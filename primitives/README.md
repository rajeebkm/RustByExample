# Primitives

Rust provides access to a wide variety of primitives. A sample includes:

## Scalar Types

1. signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 and isize (pointer size)
2. unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 and usize (pointer size)
3. floating point: f32, f64
4. char Unicode scalar values like 'a', 'α' and '∞' (4 bytes each)
5. bool either true or false
6. and, the unit type (), whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ()

Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

## Compound Types

1. arrays like [1, 2, 3]
2. tuples like (1, true)

Variables can always be type annotated. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a suffix or by default. Integers default to i32 and floats to f64. Note that Rust can also infer types from context.
