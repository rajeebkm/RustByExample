# Structures

There are three types of structures ("structs") that can be created using the struct keyword:

1. Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples.
2. The classic C structs
3. Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.

## Activity

### 1. Add a function rect_area which calculates the area of a Rectangle (try using nested destructuring).

### 2. Add a function square which takes a Point and a f32 as arguments, and returns a Rectangle with its top left corner on the point, and a width and height corresponding to the f32.
